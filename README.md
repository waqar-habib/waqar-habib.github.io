Hi! I'm Waqar, a Web Designer & Developer from Houston, TX. 

I love to design creative and elegant websites and apps using HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript and its popular frameworks. Utilizing front-end technologies combined with server-side frameworks I've worked on several projects - solo and with an Agile team. I love to cook, while pretending I'm a chef - and keep up with all things IoT in my pastime.
